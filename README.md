# Responsive Table Design

This project is a responsive table design that adapts to different screen sizes. It uses only HTML and CSS to create a clean and user-friendly interface for displaying tabular data.

## Responsive Design

The table is designed to be fully responsive, meaning it will adjust its layout based on the screen size. On smaller screens, the table will stack its rows vertically, making it easier to read and navigate.
